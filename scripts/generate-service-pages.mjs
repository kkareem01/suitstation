    description: 'Slim fit suits in Gainesville, GA. Tapered chest and trim leg cut for a modern silhouette, master tailors on-site, alterations in 3-5 days.',
    intro: 'Slim fit reads modern, sharp, and intentional. The shoulder is closer to your frame, the chest is leaner through the torso, and the trousers taper from knee to hem with a clean break. It is the cut for men who run lean, who want their tailoring to look current rather than corporate-conservative, and who do not want excess fabric pooling at the waist or pant hem.',
    body: 'A slim fit is not a skinny fit. The cardinal mistake we correct on walk-ins is a jacket that pulls at the button when buttoned, or shoulder seams that ride up onto the deltoid because the customer sized down to chase a trend. Real slim fit fits the shoulder bone clean, allows a flat hand under the lapel, and lets the trouser sit on the hip without straining the seat. We stock slim fit in navy, charcoal, mid-grey, and black across 36S to 50R, with extra inventory in 38R and 40R because that is the most common slim build. Tailors at Pearl Nix Pkwy can dial sleeve, waist suppression, and trouser taper in 3 to 5 business days. Slim fit pairs naturally with a 2.5-inch tie, a slim-collar dress shirt, and a leaner silhouette shoe.',
    serviceType: 'Slim fit men\'s suits',
    faqs: [
      ['Is slim fit the same as skinny fit?', 'No. Skinny fit is a tapered, often unforgiving silhouette that pulls across the chest and seat. Slim fit is a modern cut that follows the body without straining. If your jacket pulls at the button or your trousers crease at the seat when seated, you are in skinny fit, not slim. We re-fit dozens of customers a month who mistakenly bought skinny when they wanted slim.'],
      ['Can a slim fit suit be tailored to fit a heavier build?', 'Sometimes, but the better answer for heavier builds is a modern fit, not a slim. Slim fit is patterned with a leaner chest and trimmer waist. If you are carrying weight in the midsection, the slim cut will pull and create horizontal stress lines no tailor can remove. We will be honest with you at the fitting and steer you toward modern fit if the slim is fighting your frame.'],
      ['How tapered are the trousers on a slim fit suit?', 'Our slim fit trousers taper from a 19 to 19.5 inch knee down to a 15 to 15.5 inch hem on a size 32 waist. That is narrow enough to read modern but wide enough to drop cleanly over a dress shoe. We can taper further on request — down to 14.5 inch hem — but past that the silhouette tips into skinny territory and starts limiting shoe choice.'],
      ['What occasions is slim fit appropriate for?', 'Weddings, business in tech and creative industries, prom, date nights, photo shoots, and any time you want a modern silhouette. For finance, law, courtroom, and senior board interviews, modern or classic fit is the safer choice — slim can read too fashion-forward in those rooms. For everything else, slim is the default modern silhouette.'],
      ['Do you stock slim fit in big and tall sizes?', 'Slim fit by definition is patterned for leaner builds, so we do not carry true slim fit in big and tall. What we do offer is a tapered modern fit in larger sizes that captures the same modern silhouette without straining. Ask for it by name at the door — our tailors call it the "tapered modern" and it covers 46R through 56R in navy and charcoal.'],

    name: 'Modern Fit Suits',
    description: 'Modern fit suits in Gainesville, GA. The flattering middle ground between slim and classic — clean shoulder, slight chest taper, in-house tailoring.',
    intro: 'Modern fit is the suit cut most men actually want once they try all three. It is leaner than classic and roomier than slim, with a clean shoulder, a slight chest taper, and a trouser that drops straight without clinging or ballooning. Most of the suits we sell at Suit Station are modern fit because most builds — average to athletic with some midsection — wear it best.',
    body: 'A classic fit suit hangs straight off the shoulder with extra room through the chest and waist. A slim fit hugs the body close. Modern fit lives in between: it follows the natural taper of the torso without forcing it. The jacket has a slight waist suppression so it does not look boxy, the chest sits clean, and the sleeve has enough room for movement without bunching. Trousers in our modern fit run a 19.5 to 20 inch knee and a 16 inch hem on a 32 waist, which works with any standard dress shoe and never pools at the ankle. We stock modern fit in every staple color — navy, charcoal, mid-grey, light grey, black, brown — and it is the cut we default to for first-time suit buyers, weddings, work, and most professional settings. If you are not sure which fit to buy, modern is the safe answer 70 percent of the time.',
    serviceType: 'Modern fit men\'s suits',
    faqs: [
      ['What is the difference between modern fit and slim fit?', 'Modern fit has a touch more room in the chest, a slightly straighter cut through the waist, and a less aggressive trouser taper than slim. Slim follows the body close. Modern follows the body but gives you a half inch of breathing room everywhere. If you are unsure which to buy, modern is the more universally flattering cut.'],
      ['Is modern fit good for a heavier or athletic build?', 'Yes — modern fit is usually the right answer for athletic builds (broad shoulders, larger thighs) and for builds carrying weight in the midsection. The slight waist suppression keeps it from looking boxy, and the extra chest room prevents pulling across the front. Our tailors can dial in further suppression at the waist if you want a leaner read without going to slim.'],
      ['How does modern fit compare to classic fit?', 'Classic fit is the traditional cut your father wore — straight through the body, fuller chest, full-leg trouser. It is forgiving but reads dated. Modern fit took everything good about classic and trimmed the excess. Most men who think they want classic actually look better in modern — the photographs do not lie.'],
      ['Can modern fit be tailored slimmer if I want?', 'Yes. Tailors can take in the waist, suppress the side seams, and taper the trouser leg toward a slim silhouette without changing the shoulder or chest pattern. This is the easiest way to get a slim look without the constraints of buying a true slim fit. Standard turn 3-5 days, line-item pricing.'],
      ['What occasions is modern fit best for?', 'Almost all of them — work, weddings, funerals, court, business meetings, dates, prom for older guys, and travel. Modern fit is the daily-driver cut. If you own one suit, it should be a navy modern fit two-piece. If you own two, the second is charcoal modern fit. After that, you build out fits and patterns for specific occasions.'],

    name: 'Classic Fit Suits',
    description: 'Classic fit suits in Gainesville, GA. Traditional full-cut silhouette for boardroom, court, and conservative dress codes. Tailored on-site.',
    intro: 'Classic fit is the traditional men\'s suit cut — straight through the chest, fuller across the back and shoulders, and a full-leg trouser with a generous break at the shoe. It is the suit you wear for serious occasions where the room is conservative and the message is competence, not fashion. Lawyers, executives, clergy, courtroom witnesses, and older customers heading to formal events still ask for classic fit by name.',
    body: 'Classic fit is not outdated — it is appropriate. There are rooms in this country where a slim or modern silhouette reads young, where a partner-track lawyer wants the suit to disappear so the argument lands, where a senior pastor stands in front of a congregation and the cut should not draw the eye. Classic fit handles all of those rooms. Our classic fit jackets are patterned with a fuller chest, a straighter side seam (no waist suppression), and a longer length. Trousers run a 21 inch knee and a 17.5 to 18 inch hem on a 32 waist with a full one-inch break. We stock classic fit in navy, charcoal, mid-grey, black, and brown across 36R through 60L, including big and tall. The pattern grades up cleanly into larger sizes, which is one reason it remains the default for many older and heavier customers.',
    serviceType: 'Classic fit men\'s suits',
    faqs: [
      ['Is classic fit the same as regular fit or traditional fit?', 'Yes. Different brands use different names — classic fit, regular fit, traditional fit, full fit, American cut — but they all describe the same idea: a straight, fuller silhouette without modern waist suppression or trim taper. Some older European brands also call this "British cut" though the British have their own newer cuts now too.'],
      ['Who should buy classic fit instead of modern fit?', 'Men over 55 who have always worn classic and are comfortable in it. Men in conservative professions (law, government, finance senior leadership, clergy) where the dress code is unspoken but absolute. Men carrying significant weight in the midsection where a modern cut still pulls. And anyone who tried modern fit and felt the cut was "too tight" or "too fashion-forward" — classic is the answer.'],
      ['Can a classic fit suit be tailored to look more modern?', 'Yes, with limits. We can suppress the waist a half inch, shorten the jacket length slightly, and taper the trouser leg from a 17.5 hem down to a 16. Beyond that, the pattern itself is too straight to convert into modern fit. If you want a meaningfully more modern look, buy modern fit instead — it will be cheaper than over-tailoring a classic.'],
      ['Does classic fit come in big and tall?', 'Yes — classic fit is the default cut in big and tall sizing because the pattern grades up cleanly and works on heavier and taller builds without forcing. We stock big and tall classic fit through 60L, with shorter waists on request and extra-long trousers for taller customers up to 6 foot 6.'],
      ['What break should I get on classic fit trousers?', 'Full break — meaning the trouser hem rests on the shoe and creates one clean horizontal fold above it. Half break and no break read as more modern and clash with the classic silhouette. Full break is what the classic cut was designed for and what every classic-fit customer should default to.'],

    description: 'Big & tall suits in Gainesville, GA. Sizes 46R-60L plus extra-tall trousers. Real inventory, in-house tailoring, no special order delays.',
    intro: 'Most stores treat big and tall like a footnote — a small rack at the back, two colors, three sizes, everything else is special order with a six-week wait. We do not. Suit Station stocks big and tall suits in navy, charcoal, mid-grey, light grey, black, and brown across 46R, 46L, 48R, 48L, 50R, 50L, 52R, 52L, 54R, 56R, and up to 60L on the floor. If you can walk in, we can fit you that day.',
    body: 'The hardest part of buying a big or tall suit is finding one that does not look like it was built around the size, with everything else as an afterthought. Pattern grading matters: a poorly graded 54R jacket has a head that looks too small for the body, a sleeve that runs short, and a chest that pulls because the manufacturer just scaled up a 40R without re-balancing the proportions. We carry big and tall lines that grade cleanly — meaning the shoulder, chest, sleeve, and skirt of the jacket all stay in proportion to each other through the size run. Tall sizes (46L, 48L, 50L, 52L) get an extra inch in jacket length and an extra inch in sleeve. Big sizes (46R through 60R) get the proper fuller chest and seat without throwing off the shoulder line. Tailors on-site can extend trousers to a 36 or 38 inseam on request and let out the seat or waist up to two inches without issue.',
    serviceType: 'Big and tall men\'s suits',
    faqs: [
      ['What sizes do you carry in big and tall?', 'On the rack: 46R, 46L, 48R, 48L, 50R, 50L, 52R, 52L, 54R, 56R, 58R, 60R, 60L. Trousers extend to a 36 inseam stocked, 38 on request. Shirts run up to 22-inch neck and 38-inch sleeve. We can special order beyond 60L but standard inventory should fit 95 percent of big and tall customers walk-in.'],
      ['Do you tailor big and tall on-site?', 'Yes. All alterations are done in-house by master tailors. Standard turn is 3 to 5 business days. Letting out a seat, extending an inseam, taking in shoulders, and converting a regular into a long are all done on the premises — we do not ship out for any of it.'],
      ['How long do big and tall suits take to get if my size is not on the floor?', 'For sizes we stock (everything listed above), same-day or next-day after alterations. For special orders beyond stocked sizes, expect 2 to 3 weeks. For weddings, funerals, or rush jobs we will tell you the realistic timeline before you commit and refund deposits if we cannot meet it.'],
      ['What suit cuts are available in big and tall?', 'Classic fit is the default cut and what we recommend for most big and tall builds — the pattern grades cleanly and the silhouette flatters. Modern fit is available with mild waist suppression if you want a less boxy look. We do not stock true slim fit in big and tall because the pattern strains on larger frames; we offer a "tapered modern" that gives a leaner read without forcing it.'],
      ['Do you carry big and tall tuxedos?', 'Yes — black notch lapel and shawl collar tuxedos in 46R through 56R, and white dinner jackets through 52R. White tie tail coats can be special-ordered in big sizes with 4 to 6 weeks lead. Big and tall groomsmen packages are common — we run them every wedding season.'],

    description: 'Homecoming suits in Gainesville, GA. Color-coordinated with your date, group rates, fast 3-5 day alterations, sized for high schoolers.',
    intro: 'Homecoming is not prom and the suit should not look like prom either. The dress codes are slightly more relaxed, the photo expectations are slightly less formal, and most schools in Hall County (Gainesville High, North Hall, Chestatee, Flowery Branch) lean toward color suits or bolder pattern blazers paired with darker trousers rather than full black-tie tuxedos.',
    body: 'The two looks that win homecoming photos year after year: option one — a color suit (burgundy, hunter green, navy, dusty pink, or sage) with a white shirt and a pocket square that ties to the date\'s dress. Option two — a patterned blazer (glen check, herringbone, plaid) with charcoal or black dress trousers, a knit tie, and brown loafers. Both signal "I dressed up but I am not trying to win prom king." We coordinate the suit color with the date\'s dress at the fitting — bring a swatch or a clear photo and we will pull options that match cleanly. Group rates kick in at 4+ guys booking together. Standard alteration turn is 3 to 5 business days; if homecoming is a week out and you walk in panicked, we run same-day rush on hems and waist for $10.',
    serviceType: 'Homecoming suits',
    faqs: [
      ['What color suit should I wear for homecoming?', 'It depends on your date\'s dress. Burgundy and hunter green are the safest crowd-pleasers. Dusty pink, sage, and powder blue are popular pastel options that work especially well in fall. Navy is the classic neutral. We will match the suit to a dress swatch at the fitting — text us a photo of the dress before you come in and we will pull options.'],
      ['Is a tuxedo too formal for homecoming?', 'For most Hall County high schools, yes. Homecoming dress codes are typically less strict than prom — a sharp suit reads better than a full tuxedo. If your school does a black-tie homecoming or you are going to a particularly formal one, a black notch-lapel tuxedo is appropriate, but the default is a suit.'],
      ['How early should I book my homecoming suit?', '3 weeks before the dance is the sweet spot. That gives time for fitting, alterations, and a final try-on. If your homecoming is in 6 days, walk in and we will do same-day rush on alterations for $10 above standard. We fit homecoming groups every fall and have the inventory and tailors to make tight timelines work.'],
      ['Do you offer group rates for homecoming?', 'Yes — 4 or more guys booking together get a 10 percent group discount on suits and free coordination. Bring everyone to the same fitting if possible, or have one person send the group\'s sizes and color preference and we will assemble it. Group orders ship together and are easier to coordinate at pickup.'],
      ['What shoes go with a color homecoming suit?', 'For burgundy, hunter green, and navy, dark brown leather loafers or oxfords work cleanly. For pastels (dusty pink, sage, powder blue), white sneakers can read fashion-forward but lighter brown loafers are safer. Black dress shoes with a color suit can read mismatched — avoid unless the suit is very dark.'],

    description: 'Quinceañera suits in Gainesville, GA. Coordinated chambelán suits, color-matched to the quinceañera\'s theme, group fittings, alterations on-site.',
    intro: 'A quinceañera court (chambelanes) needs to look uniformly sharp — same color, same fit, same accessories — without looking costumed. Most Gainesville and Hall County families coming through Suit Station for a quinceañera have between 5 and 14 chambelanes plus the chambelán de honor. We have run dozens of these over the years and the system that works is one fitting day for the full court, identical suits in the quinceañera\'s chosen color, and master tailors finishing everyone in the same 3 to 5 day window.',
    body: 'The most common quinceañera color schemes we see: white suits with the theme color in the tie, vest, and pocket square; full color suits (burgundy, navy, royal blue, hunter green, blush, lavender, gold) for the entire court; and black suits with theme-color accessories. Each works — the choice depends on the quinceañera\'s theme and budget. We stock white tuxedo jackets and white dinner jackets in 36R through 52R for traditional white-suit courts, and we color-match accessories to roughly 24 standard colors plus custom dye-to-match on request (lead time 2 to 3 weeks for custom dye). The chambelán de honor often wears a slightly different look — a darker accent, a different lapel pin, a bow tie instead of long tie — to distinguish him as the lead. We coordinate all of this at one fitting if everyone can come together, otherwise individual fittings tied to the same color and fit profile.',
    serviceType: 'Quinceañera suits and chambelán packages',
    faqs: [
      ['How much do quinceañera suits cost per chambelán?', 'Standard suit packages run $229 to $329 per chambelán depending on fabric and color. White tuxedo jackets are $279. Full custom dye-to-match runs $449+ with 2 to 3 weeks lead. Group rates kick in at 6 or more chambelanes for 10 percent off, and quinceañera courts of 12+ get free coordination services.'],
      ['How long do we need before the quinceañera to book?', '6 to 8 weeks is ideal — that gives time for everyone to fit, alterations, and a final try-on with all chambelanes wearing the suits to confirm the group look. For custom dye-to-match colors, push to 10 to 12 weeks. For tighter timelines (under 4 weeks), stick to in-stock colors and we will rush alterations.'],
      ['Can the chambelán de honor wear something different?', 'Yes — and we recommend it. The chambelán de honor (the lead escort) typically wears a slight differentiator: a different vest color (often white when the court wears the theme color), a bow tie instead of a long tie, a unique lapel pin or pocket square, or a darker accent shade. The visual hierarchy reads cleanly in photos.'],
      ['Do you handle bilingual fittings?', 'Yes. We have Spanish-speaking staff at the Pearl Nix Pkwy showroom available by appointment. Mention you need bilingual support when you book and we will schedule with the right team. All fitting paperwork, group coordination sheets, and pickup instructions can be provided in Spanish on request.'],
      ['Do younger boys (pajes) get fitted differently?', 'Yes — pajes (young boys in the court, often 5 to 12 years old) wear scaled-down versions of the chambelán look. We carry boys\' suits 4 through 18 in matching colors and can coordinate identical accessories. Boys\' suits are often $129 to $179 and tailor on-site like adult suits, with extra hem allowance for growth.'],

    intro: 'A graduation suit needs to do two jobs. It has to look right under the gown for ceremony photos, and it has to be the suit you actually wear after — at the graduation dinner, at family weddings, at first interviews. We do not sell costume suits that look great once and live in a closet after. Most graduation customers walk out of Suit Station with a suit they will rotate for the next 3 to 5 years.',
    body: 'For high school graduation: the gown is going on and off in photos, so the shirt collar, tie, and lapels are visible. We recommend modern fit in navy or charcoal, white dress shirt, conservative tie. Color suits are fine for outdoor or evening graduations but the dark neutrals always photograph cleaner under a gown. For college graduation: the same advice, but stepped up in fabric — Super 110s minimum, because this suit is going to your first job interviews. For graduate school (medical school, law school, MBA): charcoal modern or classic fit, premium fabric, treat it as your first professional suit and budget accordingly. We coordinate family photos at the fitting too — most graduation customers come in with a parent or sibling who also needs a suit, and we run combined fittings to streamline.',
    serviceType: 'Graduation suits',
    faqs: [
      ['What color suit should I wear for graduation?', 'Navy or charcoal. Both photograph cleanly under a graduation gown and both work as everyday professional suits after the ceremony. Black is acceptable but reads slightly more formal. Color suits (burgundy, green, blue) photograph well outdoors but limit the suit\'s use afterward.'],
      ['Should I buy or rent for graduation?', 'Buy. Graduation suits get worn 6 to 10 more times in the year after — interviews, family events, weddings, dinners. Rentals do not fit as well, do not photograph as well, and cost half what a buy would on a per-wear basis once you do the math. We have starter graduation suits at $199 that look as sharp as a $400 rental.'],
      ['How early should I order my graduation suit?', '4 to 6 weeks before the ceremony. That covers fitting, alterations, and a final try-on under the actual gown if the school provides one early. If you are inside 2 weeks, walk in and we will rush alterations same-day for $10 above standard.'],

      ['Will my graduation suit work for a job interview after?', 'If you buy navy or charcoal modern or classic fit — yes, perfectly. That is the entire point.

    description: 'Church suits in Gainesville, GA. Sunday-ready three-piece, classic two-piece, and traditional cuts. Stocked colors include white, navy, and grey.',
    intro: 'Church wear in north Georgia spans every tradition — Baptist, Methodist, AME, Catholic, Pentecostal, non-denominational — and dress codes range from coat-and-tie casual to formal three-piece. What unites them is that the suit signals respect for the space, and the cut matters more than the trend. Church suits we sell most often: three-piece in classic or modern fit, traditional two-piece in conservative colors, and lighter-weight summer suits for July and August Sundays in non-air-conditioned sanctuaries.',
    body: 'For most weekly Sunday wear: a modern fit two-piece in navy or charcoal handles 95 percent of services and special occasions (baptisms, communions, dedications). For deacon, minister, or church leadership: a three-piece in classic fit signals authority and reads cleanly under a robe or stole when applicable. For Easter and high holidays: many congregations expect a lighter color — cream, light grey, or stone — and we stock those seasonally starting in February. For funerals and memorials in church settings: navy or charcoal, never bright colors. We carry church suits across 36S through 60L including big and tall, and we tailor to a relaxed sit-and-stand fit (slightly more room in the seat, slightly looser through the chest) appropriate for services where you stand, sit, and rise repeatedly.',
    serviceType: 'Church suits',
    faqs: [
      ['Do you carry traditional Black church suit styles?', 'Yes — three-piece suits with vest detailing, double-breasted classic fit, longer-line jackets, and traditional palette options including burgundy, gold accent, royal blue, and cream. We stock these year-round and our tailors are familiar with the cut traditions and proportions that matter for Black church wear in the AME, Baptist, and COGIC traditions specifically.'],
      ['What weight fabric is best for summer church services?', 'Tropical wool or wool blend in 7 to 8 ounce weight. Many older sanctuaries in Hall County run hot in July and August and a heavyweight winter wool will be punishing. We stock summer-weight suits in cream, light grey, navy, and stone starting March each year. Linen blends are also available for the most casual summer dress codes.'],
      ['Are three-piece suits standard for church?', 'For deacons, ministers, and church leadership, often yes. For lay members it varies by congregation — some churches lean three-piece for Sunday formals and high holidays, others prefer two-piece for weekly wear. Match what your pastor and the older men in your congregation wear, and you will be calibrated correctly. We will ask which church you attend at the fitting and adjust recommendations accordingly.'],
      ['Do you do alterations for senior church members?', 'Yes. Many of our church customers are over 65 and we tailor for comfort and ease of movement — slightly relaxed waist, longer rise on the trousers, looser sleeve. Dress shirts get adjusted collars to accommodate aging neck circumference. We have served the Hall County church community for years and the senior fit is one of our specialties.'],
      ['What colors are appropriate for an Easter church service?', 'Lighter than weekly Sunday wear. Cream, light grey, stone, light blue, and pastel-accent ties are all on-tradition for Easter in most Christian traditions. Avoid black on Easter — it reads as funeral. We expand our light-color church suit inventory each February in time for Easter season and Spring high holidays.'],

    description: 'Boys & kids suits in Gainesville, GA. Sizes 2T to 18, hem allowance for growth, on-site tailoring, color matching for weddings and ceremonies.',
    intro: 'A kids\' suit needs to fit cleanly today and have enough hem allowance to last past the next growth spurt — because a boy who fits a size 8 in March may need a 10 by July, and the suit you buy for cousin\'s wedding in April should still work for grandpa\'s birthday in October. We pattern our boys\' suits with extra hem allowance built into the trousers and sleeves so a tailor can let them out as the boy grows.',
    body: 'We carry boys\' and kids\' suits across the full size run: 2T, 3T, 4T, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, plus husky variations. Most ceremonial occasions — weddings, ring bearer duties, baptisms, communions, funerals, school formals, quinceañera courts — need a coordinated look that matches an adult suit somewhere in the family or the wedding party. We color-match boys\' suits to adult inventory across 24 standard colors so a 6-year-old ring bearer\'s navy suit reads as the same navy as the groom\'s. Tailors hem trousers, take in waists, and shorten sleeves on-site in 3 to 5 days. For boys with significant growth between purchase and event, we leave 2 inches of hem allowance and offer a free re-hem within 90 days if the timeline stretches.',

Trousers run with adjustable elastic waists in toddler sizes and traditional belt-loop waists from size 8 up. Most colors and patterns are available across the size range.'],
      ['Can a kids\' suit be color-matched to an adult suit for a wedding?', 'Yes — that is a common request. Bring a swatch or a photo of the adult suit and we will pull the matching boys\' size in the same color family. For full-court matching (5+ kids in identical colors), order at least 6 weeks ahead so we can confirm dye lots match across the full inventory.'],
      ['How much do boys\' suits cost?', 'Toddler suits (2T-4T): $89-$129. Boys 5-7: $119-$159. Boys 8-18: $129-$199. Husky cuts: $149-$219. Full tuxedo packages with vest, bow tie, and shoes for ring bearers run $179-$249 depending on size and accessory level.'],
      ['What if my son grows between fitting and event?', 'We build 2 inches of hem allowance into trouser hems and 1 inch into sleeves on most boys\' suits, and our tailors can let those out for free if the suit is bought within 90 days of the event. If a child outgrows a size entirely (boys 8-12 do this fast), we offer a 30 percent trade-in credit on the next size up within 90 days.'],
      ['Do you do communion and baptism suits?', 'Yes — white communion suits in sizes 5 through 12 are stocked seasonally (March through May for First Communion season). Baptism suits and christening outfits in white and cream are stocked year-round in toddler sizes. Both can be tailored on-site in 3 to 5 days and we coordinate the look with family members\' attire on request.'],

    name: 'Sport Coats & Blazers',
    description: 'Sport coats & blazers in Gainesville, GA. Patterned, textured, and solid blazers worn standalone — not part of a suit. Tailored on-site.',
    intro: 'A sport coat or blazer is a tailored jacket worn without matching trousers — different rules, different fabrics, different occasions than a suit jacket. The line gets blurred online but the distinction matters: you cannot wear a navy suit jacket as a blazer (the fabric is too refined and the cut reads weird without the matching trousers), and you cannot wear a tweed sport coat to a black-tie event no matter how nicely it is tailored.',
    body: 'Blazers and sport coats live in the smart-casual to business-casual range. A solid navy blazer with grey trousers is the classic American look — works at the office (in casual industries), at dinner, at less formal weddings, and as a travel jacket. A patterned sport coat (glen check, herringbone, plaid, hopsack) goes with charcoal trousers, tan chinos, or even dark denim depending on the occasion. Texture is what separates a great sport coat from a great suit jacket — tweed, hopsack, linen, flannel, corduroy. Suit jackets are smooth wool because they need to look polished. Sport coats can have weight and grip because they read intentional and personal. We stock 2-button modern fit blazers in navy, mid-grey, and charcoal across 36S through 56L, plus a rotating pattern wall (currently glen check, charcoal herringbone, brown plaid, navy hopsack) that turns over seasonally. Master tailors fit and finish in 3 to 5 days.',
    serviceType: 'Men\'s sport coats and blazers',
    faqs: [
      ['What is the difference between a blazer and a sport coat?', 'Technically: a blazer is solid (most often navy) with metal buttons, derived from naval and rowing club origins. A sport coat is patterned or textured (tweed, herringbone, glen check, plaid) with horn or fabric-covered buttons. Practically: the terms are used interchangeably in American menswear and you do not need to overthink it.'],
      ['Can I wear my suit jacket as a blazer?', 'Generally no. Suit jackets are made of smooth, refined wool that reads strange paired with non-matching trousers. The cut is also typically less casual than a true blazer. There are exceptions — some unstructured suit jackets in textured fabrics work standalone — but the safe rule is: buy a real blazer for blazer use and keep your suit jackets with their matching trousers.'],
      ['What trousers go with a navy blazer?', 'Mid-grey or charcoal flat-front dress trousers are the safest. Tan or stone chinos read more casual and are appropriate for smart-casual offices. Darker denim works for true casual occasions. Avoid black trousers with a navy blazer — the contrast reads off. White trousers work in summer with a navy blazer and read distinctly nautical.'],
      ['How should a sport coat fit differently than a suit jacket?', 'A sport coat can sit slightly looser than a suit jacket because it is meant to be worn over varied trouser weights and shirts. The shoulder still fits clean, but the chest can have a quarter inch more room and the waist suppression can be subtler. We tailor sport coats with a slightly more relaxed cut by default and adjust based on customer preference.'],
      ['Do you carry textured fabrics like tweed and hopsack?', 'Yes — tweed in autumn and winter (October through February), hopsack year-round, herringbone in mid-weight wool year-round, and glen check in lighter weight for spring and summer. Linen and linen-blend sport coats arrive in March for spring and summer wear. Pattern selection rotates with the season; ask what is in stock when you visit.'],

    description: 'Dress pants in Gainesville, GA. Flat-front and pleated, in wool, wool blend, and chino. Hemmed on-site, paired with blazers or worn standalone.',
    intro: 'Dress pants are the most-bought, least-considered piece of menswear. Most guys own two pairs that came with suits, two pairs of khakis from a department store, and that is the whole rotation. We sell a lot of standalone dress pants because once a customer realizes a real pair of wool flat-front trousers tailored properly will outlast and outperform any chino, they buy three pairs.',
    body: 'Standalone dress pants come in three categories. Wool dress trousers (charcoal, navy, mid-grey, black) are the workhorse — pair with any blazer, any dress shirt, dress every business-casual office in north Georgia. Wool blend or polyester blend dress pants are the budget option — half the price, 80 percent of the look, faster wrinkle release if you travel. Chinos are casual dress pants in cotton or cotton blend (tan, stone, navy, charcoal) for smart-casual offices and weekend dressed-up. We stock all three in flat-front modern fit (the default) and pleated classic fit (for traditional cuts and bigger builds). Hems are done on-site in same-day to 3 days depending on volume. Cuffs add $5; pleats are an alteration we do not perform after the fact, so order pleated or flat-front as you want it.',
    serviceType: 'Men\'s dress pants',
    faqs: [
      ['What is the difference between flat-front and pleated dress pants?', 'Flat-front pants have a clean, smooth front from waist to hem — the modern, leaner look. Pleated pants have one or two folds at the waist that release fabric across the front of the thigh, providing extra room. Flat-front works on lean and average builds and reads modern. Pleats work on heavier or athletic builds (large thighs, larger waist) and read more traditional.'],
      ['What dress pant break should I get?', 'For business and modern looks: half break (one slight fold above the shoe). For traditional and classic fits: full break (the hem rests on the shoe, one clean fold). For very modern, fashion-forward looks: no break (the hem stops just above the shoe). We default to half break for most customers and adjust based on cut and personal preference.'],
      ['How much do hem alterations cost?', 'Standard hem with no cuff: $15. Hem with cuff added: $20. Same-day rush hem: +$10 above standard. Most dress pants we sell come unhemmed and the hem is included in the purchase price; only a re-hem on a previously hemmed pair carries the alteration charge.'],
      ['Can dress pants be worn casually with a polo or sweater?', 'Wool dress pants — generally no, they look out of place with truly casual tops. Chinos — yes, that is exactly their use case. Wool blend dress pants — depends on the blend; the heavier and more refined the wool blend, the less casual it reads. If you want one pair of pants that bridges work and weekend, buy chinos in charcoal or stone.'],
      ['Do you stock dress pants in extended sizes?', 'Yes. Waist 28 through 56, inseam 28 through 36 stocked, longer inseams up to 38 by special order. Big and tall dress pants in classic fit run through 56. Husky cut available in select colors. Tailors on-site can let waists out 2 inches and seats out 1 inch on most patterns.'],

    intro: 'A wedding tuxedo is not a rental call — it is the photo you live with for 50 years. We take the same fitting time on a wedding tuxedo as we do on a custom suit, because the suit hangs in a closet a few times a year but the wedding photo hangs on a wall forever. Wedding tuxedos at Suit Station are sold to keep, tailored to the groom\'s frame, and coordinated across the entire groomsmen party.',
    body: 'The three wedding tuxedo silhouettes that win in 2026: option one — classic black notch lapel or shawl collar tuxedo with a white pleated shirt, black bow tie, and patent leather oxfords (timeless, never reads dated). Option two — midnight navy tuxedo with a black satin lapel (reads richer than black on camera and unique without being trendy). Option three — ivory dinner jacket with black trousers (summer wedding, outdoor venue, golden hour photos). For groomsmen: keep them in black tuxedos one shade simpler than the groom — same lapel style, same bow tie color, simpler shirt. The visual hierarchy in photos is: groom slightly different, groomsmen uniform behind him. We coordinate the full party at one fitting whenever possible. Standard turn 3 to 5 weeks for full groomsmen orders, 3 to 5 days for groom-only.',
    serviceType: 'Wedding tuxedos',
    faqs: [
      ['Should I buy or rent my wedding tuxedo?', 'Buy, in nearly every case. The fit is significantly better, you have it for life, the per-wear math works out cheaper than 2 to 3 future rentals, and the photos are dramatically better in a tailored tuxedo than a rented one. Rentals make sense for groomsmen who genuinely will not wear a tuxedo again — but for the groom, buy.'],
      ['What is the difference between a notch lapel and a shawl collar tuxedo?', 'Shawl collar is a single curved lapel that wraps around the chest — the most formal, classic, and reads richest in photos. Notch lapel is the standard suit-style lapel with a small notch cut into it — slightly less formal but more versatile. Peak lapel is the third option — pointed lapels that read bold and modern. For weddings we recommend shawl for traditional black-tie and notch for slightly less formal evening weddings.'],
      ['Can groomsmen wear a different tuxedo than the groom?', 'Slightly different is good — radically different is bad. The visual rule: groom in shawl collar, groomsmen in notch lapel (same color). Or groom with a unique bow tie color, groomsmen in black bow ties. Or groom with a vest, groomsmen in cummerbunds. Pick one differentiator. Two or more differences make the photo look chaotic.'],
      ['How early should the wedding party order tuxedos?', '4 to 5 months out is ideal. Tuxedo inventory in specific colors and sizes can run thin in May and June (peak wedding season), so ordering early secures the lot. For tighter timelines (under 8 weeks) we will work with what is in stock and rush if needed, but options narrow.'],
      ['Do you do destination wedding tuxedo shipping?', 'Yes. Wedding tuxedos can be shipped to destination wedding venues domestically or internationally. We package each groomsman\'s set individually with tailoring complete and labeled with name. Shipping cost varies by destination; for Caribbean and Mexico destinations it usually runs $80 to $150 per set door-to-door.'],

    intro: 'Slim fit tuxedos are what you wear when the formality is dialed up but the silhouette is dialed modern. The cut is the same as our slim fit suits — closer through the chest, suppressed at the waist, tapered trousers — but built around tuxedo construction (satin lapels, satin stripe down the trouser, no belt loops). Most of our prom tuxedo orders are slim fit, and an increasing share of younger grooms are choosing slim over classic for weddings.',
    body: 'A slim fit tuxedo reads sharp and contemporary in photos — it does not read like a rental and it does not read like a vintage shawl-collar piece your grandfather wore. The lapels are usually 2.5 to 2.75 inches wide (rather than 3.25 to 3.5 inches on classic tuxedos), the bow tie pairs slimmer (2.25 to 2.5 inches), and the trouser ends in a 15 to 15.5 inch hem with a clean half-break over a slimmer-toe patent leather shoe. We stock slim fit tuxedos in classic black notch lapel, classic black shawl collar, midnight navy, white dinner jacket, and burgundy. Sizes 36S through 50R fit the standard slim build; for athletic builds (broad shoulders, larger thighs) we steer toward modern fit instead because slim will pull. Tailoring on-site, 3 to 5 business days for grooms, 3 to 5 weeks for full slim-fit groomsmen orders.',
    serviceType: 'Slim fit tuxedos',
    faqs: [
      ['Is slim fit too modern for a wedding tuxedo?', 'Not anymore. Slim fit tuxedos are now standard for younger grooms (typically 22 to 35 years old) and for weddings with a contemporary aesthetic. For very traditional weddings or older grooms, classic fit reads more appropriate. The wedding theme and the groom\'s personal style dictate the choice.'],
      ['Can a slim fit tuxedo be tailored if I am not lean?', 'Slim fit is patterned for leaner builds. If you are athletic with broad shoulders, the slim cut will pull at the chest and seat. We will be honest at the fitting and steer you toward modern fit if slim is fighting your frame. Modern fit tuxedos still read contemporary without forcing a body type into a pattern that does not fit.'],
      ['What tuxedo color is best in slim fit?', 'Classic black is the safest and most universally appropriate. Midnight navy reads richer in photos and is unique without being trendy. White dinner jackets work for summer outdoor weddings. Burgundy is bold and works for weddings under 60 guests where personal style is part of the show. We stock all four in slim fit.'],
      ['Do slim fit tuxedos come in big and tall?', 'No. Slim fit by pattern definition does not grade into big and tall sizes. We offer a "tapered modern" tuxedo in big and tall sizes that captures a leaner read without forcing the slim pattern onto a larger frame. Tapered modern is available in black notch and black shawl through 56R.'],
      ['What shoes pair with a slim fit tuxedo?', 'Slim-toe patent leather oxfords (formal) or sleek velvet loafers (less formal, contemporary). Avoid chunky cap-toe oxfords with slim fit tuxedos — the proportions clash. We stock both in our shoe section. Black is the only correct color for shoe choice with a black tuxedo; midnight navy tuxedos pair with black or very dark brown.'],

    intro: 'White tuxedos and white dinner jackets are summer formalwear — they belong at outdoor evening weddings, beach galas, summer charity balls, and resort black-tie events. They do not belong indoors in winter, do not belong at funerals, and do not belong at conservative church weddings before 5 PM. The right occasion makes a white tuxedo extraordinary. The wrong occasion makes it look costumed.',
    body: 'There are two white-tuxedo silhouettes most customers want. Option one is the white dinner jacket — a white tuxedo jacket worn with black formal trousers, black bow tie, and white pleated shirt. This is the classic "James Bond Goldfinger" look and it reads retro-formal in the best way. Most appropriate for summer black-tie weddings, charity galas, and yacht-club style events. Option two is the full white tuxedo — both white jacket and white trousers. This is the bolder, harder-to-pull-off look — most appropriate for tropical or beach weddings, summer prom, and certain quinceañera courts. We stock white dinner jackets in 36S through 52R year-round and full white tuxedos in 38R through 50R seasonally (March through September). Tailoring on-site, 3 to 5 business days.

      ['When is a white tuxedo appropriate?', 'Outdoor evening weddings in late spring, summer, and early fall. Beach and tropical weddings any time of year. Summer charity galas after 5 PM. White-tie summer events (rare in Hall County). Avoid white tuxedos for: indoor winter weddings, formal indoor galas in October through April, daytime weddings, and any event where the dress code is "black tie" without further specification.'],
      ['What is the difference between a white tuxedo and an ivory dinner jacket?', 'White is true bright white — reads sharp and clean but can look stark in indoor lighting. Ivory is a slight cream-warm shade that reads softer and works better in mixed lighting. For older grooms or vintage-themed weddings we recommend ivory. For contemporary or beach weddings we recommend white. Both are equally formal.'],
      ['Can I wear a white tuxedo to a black-tie event?', 'A white dinner jacket with black trousers — yes, that has been formal-evening-appropriate since the 1930s. A full white tuxedo (white jacket and white trousers) — only at outdoor or tropical events. Indoor formal galas should default to black tuxedos with the rare exception of summer events explicitly inviting white-tie alternatives.'],
      ['Do white tuxedos stain easily?', 'Yes — that is the trade-off. We recommend bringing a stain pen for the event and dry-cleaning within 48 hours after wearing. Most white-tuxedo customers wear theirs once a year and dry-clean immediately after. We stock formal stain pens at the front desk for $8 if you want to grab one before an event.'],

Most big-and-tall customers default to white dinner jacket with black trousers because the contrast slims the silhouette in photos versus full-white head-to-toe.'],

    description: 'Shirt tailoring in Gainesville, GA. Sleeve length, collar adjust, body taper, and side seams on dress shirts and casual shirts. On-site tailors.',
    intro: 'Off-the-rack dress shirts are sized for a body that does not exist — designed to fit a 50th-percentile man across height, build, and arm length all at once. Most men\'s shirts fit two of those three parameters and are wrong on the third. Shirt tailoring fixes the third one. The most common adjustments we do: sleeve length (the cuff should sit at the wrist bone with arm relaxed), body taper (the shirt should sit close at the waist when tucked, not balloon), and collar adjust (the collar should close cleanly around the neck without excess fabric or visible tension).',
    body: 'A properly tailored dress shirt is the difference between a $40 shirt and a $200 shirt — the construction and fabric matter, but the fit matters more. We tailor shirts in three main areas. Sleeve length is the most common — we shorten or lengthen sleeves to land at the wrist bone, $25 standard. Body taper through the side seams reduces blousing at the waist when tucked into trousers, $25 standard. Collar adjust either tightens or loosens the collar circumference for a cleaner closure, $15 standard. We also do shoulder narrowing on shirts where the seam sits past the deltoid (rare and complex, $45+), and full body re-cuts where a customer has lost or gained significant weight ($60+, sometimes not worth doing — we will tell you). Standard turn 3 to 5 days; rush on simple sleeve and waist jobs for $10 extra.',

    faqs: [
      ['How much does shirt tailoring cost?', 'Sleeve length: $25. Body taper through side seams: $25. Collar adjust: $15. Shoulder narrowing (rare): $45+. Cuff replacement: $30. Full body re-cut: $60+. Most customers spend $25 to $50 per shirt to bring it from off-the-rack to genuinely fitted.'],
      ['Is it worth tailoring a $40 shirt?', 'Yes — a tailored $40 shirt looks better than an untailored $150 shirt. Spending $25 on a body taper and $25 on sleeves brings a basic dress shirt to a level most off-the-rack premium shirts cannot match without their own tailoring. For everyday work shirts, this is the highest-ROI menswear spend you can make.'],
      ['Can you tailor casual shirts and polos?', 'Yes — same alterations, same pricing. Casual button-downs and polos benefit from body taper and sleeve adjust the same way dress shirts do. Polos sometimes need a shoulder seam tightening if the customer is between sizes, which runs $30.'],
      ['How long do shirt alterations take?', 'Standard turn 3 to 5 business days. Same-day rush on sleeve and waist jobs for $10 above standard, walk in by 11 AM. Complex jobs (shoulder narrowing, full re-cut) take 7 to 10 days because they require more careful work.'],

    intro: 'Formalwear is built differently than business clothing and needs to be tailored differently. Tuxedos have satin lapels that cannot be re-shaped without specialty work. Wedding gowns have boned bodices, multi-layer skirts, and bustles that take careful attention.

Standard turn 6 to 8 weeks; we cannot rush gown work because the construction is too involved.

      ['How long do wedding gown alterations take?', '6 to 8 weeks minimum. Wedding gowns have boned bodices, multi-layer skirts, and bustles that need to be sewn precisely. We will not rush gown work because the risk of mistakes is too high and the gown is too important. Plan for 8 weeks if at all possible.'],

We stock real leather across all categories and avoid the synthetic uppers that crack within a year. Sizes 7 through 14 stocked, with 13 and 14 stocked deeper than most stores because Hall County customer base runs taller and bigger-footed than national average.

Each has a use case; the cap-toe oxford in black is the most universally appropriate single shoe a man can own.'],
      ['What dress shoes match a navy suit?', 'Dark brown is the modern preferred pairing — slightly warmer in photos and reads contemporary. Black is the traditional pairing — always correct, slightly more formal. Burgundy oxblood is the bold pairing — works for weddings, prom, and personal style moments but reads off in conservative business settings.'],

Whole-cut oxford: a single-piece leather construction, very formal, reads premium; for black-tie alternatives or high-end business. Monk strap: side-buckle dress shoe, modern alternative to oxford, reads contemporary; works in fashion-forward business settings. Wing-tip oxford or brogue: decorative perforated cap, slightly less formal, reads traditional and country-formal; works for weddings, less ideal for conservative business.

      ['What is the difference between an oxford and a derby?', 'Construction: oxford has a closed lacing system (the lace flaps are sewn down to the vamp underneath) and derby has open lacing (the flaps sit on top of the vamp and open out). Effect: oxford reads more formal, sleeker; derby reads slightly less formal, more relaxed, fits broader feet better. Both are appropriate dress shoes; oxford for formal, derby for everyday.'],
      ['What color dress shoes do I need first?', 'Black cap-toe oxford. It is the most universally appropriate single dress shoe — works at funerals, formal weddings, conservative business, court appearances, anywhere. After that, dark brown is the second buy because it pairs with navy and grey suits more contemporarily than black. Then expand to oxblood, lighter brown, or wing-tips depending on style.'],
      ['How should dress shoes fit?', 'Heel locked with no slip when walking. Toe with a half-inch of room past the longest toe (usually the second toe, not the big toe). Width snug but not pinching across the ball of the foot. Most guys size up too much in dress shoes because they are used to athletic shoe fits — dress shoes should feel firmer and snugger than running shoes.'],
      ['How long should real leather dress shoes last?', 'Resoled twice over their lifetime, real leather dress shoes commonly last 8 to 15 years with rotation (wear two pairs in alternation, never the same pair two days in a row, use shoe trees overnight). Single-pair daily wear without rotation cuts the lifespan to 3 to 5 years. We sell shoe trees ($25/pair) at the counter and recommend them on every shoe purchase.'],

Brown penny with chinos and a blazer is a Saturday wedding outfit; black penny with grey trousers is business casual; loafer in any color with denim is casual sharp. Tassel loafers: dressier than penny, traditionally a lawyer-and-executive shoe, works in business and dressier social settings. Bit loafers: slightly bolder, reads fashion-forward, works in creative industries and weddings. Horsebit (Gucci-style): luxury fashion territory, reads expensive and intentional, appropriate when the rest of the outfit holds up to it. We stock penny and tassel year-round in leather and selectively in suede; bit and horsebit seasonally and in popular sizes only. All sizes 8 through 13.',
    serviceType: 'Men\'s loafers',

      ['Are loafers appropriate for business?', 'Yes — penny and tassel loafers are appropriate for business casual and smart-casual offices, which covers most non-traditional industries (tech, marketing, sales, creative, modern legal). For traditional formal business (white-shoe law firms, banking, finance senior leadership), oxfords are still preferred. The dress code is loosening but not gone.'],
      ['Should I wear socks with loafers?', 'For business and dressy occasions: yes, in a color matching your trouser. For casual and summer wear: no-show socks are acceptable and increasingly common. Going completely sockless creates moisture damage to the leather over time; if you go sockless, dedicate that pair to summer wear and rotate aggressively to let them dry between wears.'],
      ['Can loafers be worn with a suit?', 'Yes — and increasingly common in modern business settings. The pairing reads contemporary: tassel loafer with a navy suit, penny loafer with a grey suit. For traditional business or formal occasions, stick with oxfords. The loafer-with-suit combination works best with modern fit suits and softer construction; it can read off with classic fit.'],
      ['What is the difference between leather and suede loafers?', 'Material: leather is smooth full-grain hide that takes polish and shines. Suede is the underside of the hide, soft and matte texture, does not polish but reads luxurious. Use cases: leather is more universal and weatherproof; suede is dressier in some contexts but ruined by rain. We stock both and recommend leather for first-buyers, suede for second-pair expansion.'],
      ['What size loafer should I get?', 'Loafers should fit slightly tighter than oxfords because there is no lacing to adjust. Heel locked, toe with a half-inch of room, snug across the instep. Size down a half from your oxford size if you are between sizes — loafers stretch slightly with wear and start tighter than they end up. We fit on-foot at the store and exchange within 7 days if the size feels off after a few wears.'],

We coordinate the groom\'s shoe to the tuxedo and the groomsmen\'s shoes to match in style and color, with master tailors checking the full look at the final fitting.',
    serviceType: 'Wedding shoes for grooms and groomsmen',
    faqs: [
      ['What shoes go with a black tuxedo at a formal wedding?', 'Patent leather oxford. Patent leather has the high-shine finish that reads correctly in formal photos with a tuxedo. Matte black leather oxfords are acceptable but read slightly underdressed. Avoid dark brown or any color other than black with a black tuxedo at a formal wedding.'],
      ['Can groomsmen wear different shoes than the groom?', 'Slightly different is fine, radically different reads chaotic. Groom in patent leather, groomsmen in matte black leather oxfords — works. Groom in brown leather, groomsmen in matching brown — works. Groom in patent leather, groomsmen in brown loafers — does not work, the formality clashes in photos.'],
      ['What shoes for an outdoor or beach wedding?', 'Brown leather oxford or derby for outdoor lawn and barn weddings. Loafers (brown leather or suede) for casual outdoor weddings. For beach weddings, leather loafers in tan or stone, or suede loafers if the ceremony is on grass adjacent to the beach. Avoid sandals, flip-flops, and white shoes unless the dress code explicitly invites them.'],
      ['Do you stock wedding shoes in all sizes?', 'Sizes 8 through 14 stocked in patent leather oxford, matte black oxford, dark brown oxford, and brown loafer. Sizes 7 and 15 by special order with 2 to 3 weeks lead. Wide widths available in popular models. For full groomsmen orders we coordinate sizing across all attendants and confirm fit at one fitting whenever possible.'],
      ['How much do wedding shoes cost?', 'Patent leather oxford: $179. Matte black leather oxford: $149. Dark brown oxford: $149. Brown leather loafer: $129-$159. Most grooms spend $150 to $200 on wedding shoes; groomsmen typically spend $100 to $150 if buying. Rentals available for groomsmen at $39 per pair.'],

    intro: 'Prom is the one event where shoes can be loud — velvet loafers in burgundy, white patent leather oxfords, slim-toe black leather with metallic detail. Where weddings call for restraint, prom rewards intentional flair. The risk is going too far the other direction and showing up in something costumed. We pull prom shoes specifically: slimmer last, sharper toe, with color and texture options that match the slim-fit tuxedos and patterned suits prom kids actually wear.',
    body: 'Three prom shoe categories. Classic prom oxford: slim-toe black leather oxford with a sharper last than business oxfords — same construction, more contemporary silhouette. Pairs cleanly with slim-fit tuxedos and patterned prom suits. Velvet loafers: prom\'s signature shoe in 2026. Burgundy velvet, navy velvet, hunter green velvet, black velvet — slip-on, statement-making, and they read sharp in low-light prom photography. Statement leather: white patent leather oxford for a vintage prom look, oxblood plain-toe for bold contrast against navy or charcoal, metallic-detail loafers for fashion-forward prom kids. Sizes 8 through 13 stocked, special order on rare colors. Most prom shoes ship in 3 to 5 days alongside the suit or tuxedo so the whole look comes together at one pickup.',
    serviceType: 'Prom shoes',
    faqs: [
      ['What shoes go with a slim-fit prom tuxedo?', 'Slim-toe black leather oxford or velvet loafer. The proportions matter — a chunky cap-toe oxford clashes with a slim-fit tuxedo silhouette. Slim-toe oxfords keep the modern line. Velvet loafers in black or a tuxedo-coordinating color (burgundy with burgundy tux, navy with midnight navy tux) read very modern.'],
      ['Are velvet loafers appropriate for prom?', 'Yes — velvet loafers are now a defining prom shoe style for 2026. Burgundy velvet, navy velvet, hunter green velvet, and black velvet are all popular. They pair with both slim-fit suits and tuxedos and read distinctly more interesting than standard black oxfords without crossing into costume territory.'],
      ['Can I wear sneakers to prom?', 'For most Hall County high school proms, no. White leather sneakers (think classic court sneakers, premium leather construction) are starting to appear at fashion-forward proms but most schools and most parents would consider them off-dress-code. Stick with leather dress shoes or velvet loafers for prom photos.'],
      ['What color shoes for a colored prom suit (burgundy, green, navy)?', 'Brown leather loafer or oxford in a slightly darker brown than the suit. Black is acceptable but reads less coordinated. Avoid white with a colored suit — the contrast looks costumed in photos. We coordinate the shoe to the suit at the fitting; bring your suit pickup appointment with your shoe-buy appointment so we can match in person.'],
      ['How early should I order prom shoes?', '4 to 6 weeks before prom for popular sizes and colors. For velvet loafers in specific colors, push to 6 to 8 weeks because dye lots and colors run thin in peak prom season (March to May). Sizes 9 through 12 stay stocked deepest; sizes 8 and 13 can run thin in popular models by early April.'],

    intro: 'Formal shoes are the narrowest category in menswear — they exist for black-tie, white-tie, and the rare gala that demands strict formal dress. There is no business use for an opera pump and there is no casual use for patent leather. When you need formal shoes, nothing else works; when you do not, formal shoes look out of place. Most men own one pair and rotate it across formal events for years.',
    body: 'Three formal shoe categories. Patent leather oxford: the standard black-tie shoe. High-shine finish, cap-toe or plain-toe construction, paired with a black tuxedo. Reads correct in low-light formal photography in a way matte leather does not. Opera pump: the white-tie shoe — slip-on patent leather with a flat grosgrain bow at the front. Reserved for white-tie events (extremely rare in north Georgia outside of presidential balls and academic ceremonies). Evening loafer: less formal than oxford, more formal than business loafer — patent leather slip-on, often with a velvet detail, for galas and dressy private events. We stock patent leather oxfords year-round in sizes 8 through 13. Opera pumps and evening loafers in select sizes; special order with 2 to 3 weeks lead for rare requests. Care guidance: patent leather scratches easily, store in dust bags, wipe with damp cloth (no polish), buff dry.',
    serviceType: 'Formal black-tie and white-tie shoes',
    faqs: [
      ['What shoes do I wear to a black-tie event?', 'Patent leather oxford in black. Cap-toe or plain-toe construction — both correct. The high-shine finish is what makes them formal-appropriate; matte leather oxfords read underdressed at proper black-tie events and show up that way in photos. If the dress code says "black tie" and you only own matte oxfords, buy patent leather before the event.'],
      ['What is an opera pump and when do I wear it?', 'Opera pump is a slip-on patent leather formal shoe with a flat grosgrain bow on the front. It is the formally correct shoe for white-tie events — the most formal Western dress code. Outside of presidential balls, certain academic events, and embassy functions, white-tie almost never comes up. Most men never need opera pumps. If you do need them, special order with 2 to 3 weeks lead.'],
      ['How do I care for patent leather?', 'Wipe with a slightly damp cloth after wearing. Buff dry with a soft dry cloth. Store in a dust bag or with shoe trees in a dark closet — patent leather yellows in direct sunlight. Do not polish — wax polish damages the patent finish. Avoid scratches; patent leather shows them more than matte. With basic care, patent leather lasts decades because it is rarely worn.'],
      ['Can patent leather be worn with non-tuxedo outfits?', 'No. Patent leather is exclusively formalwear. Wearing patent leather oxfords with a regular suit reads costume-formal — like you grabbed the wrong shoe. Patent leather pairs only with tuxedos and white-tie ensemble. Save them for formal events and rotate matte leather for everything else.'],
      ['What size do I buy for formal shoes if I rarely wear them?', 'Same size as your dress oxfords — formal shoes are constructed on the same lasts. Most men buy formal shoes once and wear them for years; the size you fit at 30 is the size you wear at 50 unless the foot itself changes. We fit and rotate sizes at the counter; if the formal shoes feel different than your business oxfords, we exchange.'],

Quinceañera and pageant: dressier kids shoes for chambelán and pageant participation. We size kids shoes for growth: half size up from current foot size, with insoles available for tighter initial fit.

      ['What size do I buy for a child?', 'Half size up from current foot size, with a removable insole for tighter initial fit. Most kids dress shoes are worn 6 to 12 times before being outgrown, so the half-size-up trick gets the most use. We measure on-foot at the store and recommend the right size at the fitting.'],
      ['Do kids dress shoes need to be real leather?', 'For the photos and the durability, yes. Real leather holds shape, takes a polish, and looks correct next to an adult\'s real-leather formal shoes in photos. Synthetic kids dress shoes are visibly different in photos and crack within a few wears. The price difference is $20 to $40 — worth it for an event suit and shoes that will be worn 5 to 10 times.'],
      ['What shoes for a ring bearer?', 'Small-scale patent leather oxford or matte black leather oxford. Patent leather for formal black-tie weddings, matte for semi-formal weddings. We stock ring bearer sizes 6 (toddler) through 13 (youth) and special-order smaller sizes when needed for very young ring bearers.'],

      ['Can kids shoes be polished and maintained?', 'Yes — same care as adult leather shoes. Shoe polish in the matching color, soft cloth buffing, shoe trees overnight. We sell mini shoe trees for kids sizes ($8/pair) and stock kid-specific shoe care kits. With basic care, kids leather dress shoes can be passed down to siblings or sold to other parents — they retain shape and value.'],

    intro: 'A dress shirt is the most-worn piece of a man\'s formal wardrobe — worn under suits, blazers, on its own with chinos, tucked, untucked, ironed and pressed daily. The fit and fabric matter more than the rest of the outfit because the shirt sees the most direct contact and the most use.

    body: 'A first-time dress shirt buyer should start with white. Solid white dress shirt is the most universally appropriate single shirt — works under any suit, with any tie, in any business setting, at funerals, at weddings, at interviews. Second buy: light blue. Blue reads slightly less formal but warmer in photos and pairs cleanly with navy and grey suits. Third buy: French blue or pale pink — adds variety without going off-pattern. Patterned shirts (gingham, stripe, plaid) come fourth and are appropriate in business-casual settings, smart-casual, and weekends. Formal shirts (pleated front, French cuff, wing collar) are tuxedo-specific and worn rarely. We tailor every shirt: sleeve length $25, body taper $25, collar adjust $15, all standard turn 3 to 5 days. Multi-shirt alteration packages discount 10 percent at 5+ shirts.',
    serviceType: 'Men\'s dress shirts',
    faqs: [
      ['What size dress shirt should I buy?', 'Measure your neck (around where the collar will sit, not too tight) and your sleeve length (from spine center down through shoulder to wrist bone with arm slightly bent). Most off-the-rack shirts are sized neck/sleeve, like 16/34 or 17/35. We measure on-body at the store and recommend the size with the right neck and the closest sleeve length, then tailor the sleeve to match exactly.'],
      ['What is the difference between modern fit and classic fit dress shirts?', 'Modern fit has a slight body taper through the side seams and a slimmer sleeve. Classic fit is straight through the body with a fuller sleeve. Modern fit reads contemporary on lean and average builds; classic fit suits heavier and athletic builds with broader chests. We default to modern fit and tailor side seams as needed.'],
      ['Do you stock French cuff dress shirts?', 'Yes — French cuff (double cuff) dress shirts in white and light blue stocked year-round, sizes 14.5 through 18 neck. Pair with cufflinks (silver, gold, or novelty). French cuffs are slightly more formal than barrel cuffs and are appropriate for business, weddings, and formal events. They cost $20 to $30 more than equivalent barrel-cuff shirts.'],
      ['How many dress shirts should I own?', 'Working professional minimum: 5 white, 3 blue, 2 patterned. That gives a 2-week rotation of mostly-white with variety. Most professionals own 10 to 15 dress shirts and rotate aggressively to extend each shirt\'s life. We recommend buying 3 to 5 shirts at a time for the multi-shirt alteration discount and rotating from there.'],
      ['What shirt color do I wear under a navy suit?', 'White is the universal answer. Light blue reads warmer and modern. French blue is a fashion-forward third option. Avoid black or dark colors — they read costume with a navy suit. Patterned shirts (light gingham, fine stripe) work in business casual but read off in formal settings. White is always correct under navy.'],

    body: 'Pre-tied vs self-tie. Pre-tied bowties are pre-knotted with adjustable neck strap — easier, faster, never come undone, look slightly less natural in photos. Self-tie bowties require tying like a shoe — more authentic, slightly more rumpled and human in photos, can come untied at the worst time. For weddings and formal events: self-tie reads more sophisticated. For prom and pre-tied looks: pre-tied is fine and easier. Clip-on bowties are appropriate only for kids; adult clip-ons read off. Black silk bowtie is the only correct tie with a black tuxedo at a formal event. Color bowties (burgundy, navy, hunter green, blush) work for weddings, prom, and personal style. Patterned bowties (paisley, dot, plaid) work for casual smart-dressing and signature style. Sizes mostly one-size-fits-all; XL bowties available for larger neck circumference.',

      ['Pre-tied or self-tie bowtie?', 'For weddings and formal events: self-tie reads more sophisticated and authentic in photos. For prom and one-off events: pre-tied is acceptable and easier. For daily personal style: self-tie because the slight asymmetry every day reads natural. Avoid clip-on bowties on adults — they read off.'],
      ['How do I tie a self-tie bowtie?', 'Treat it like a shoelace: cross, loop, pull through. Most adjustments happen after the initial tie — the bowtie looks rumpled and intentional, not perfectly symmetric. We will demonstrate at the store and most customers tie their own within 2 to 3 attempts. YouTube tutorials are also available; the technique is simple but not intuitive.'],
      ['What color bowtie for a wedding?', 'For black-tie weddings: black silk, no exceptions. For semi-formal weddings: the bowtie can match the wedding color palette (burgundy, navy, hunter green, blush, dusty pink). For outdoor and casual weddings: patterned or knit bowties are appropriate. We coordinate to the suit and wedding palette at the fitting.'],
      ['Do bowties come in different sizes?', 'Yes — most bowties are one-size-fits-all with adjustable neck strap covering 14 to 18 inch necks. Larger sizes (extra-long bowties for 18 to 20 inch necks) available in select styles. Pre-tied bowties are slightly less adjustable than self-tie; self-tie ties are inherently fully adjustable since you tie them to fit.'],
      ['Can a bowtie be worn casually?', 'Yes — knit bowties, cotton bowties, and patterned bowties read smart-casual and work with sport coats, blazers, and even chinos plus a button-down. The all-black silk bowtie is exclusively formalwear, but most other bowties have casual use cases. The key is fabric: silk reads dressier, cotton and knit read more casual.'],

The width should roughly match the lapel width on your jacket — wider lapels need wider ties, slimmer lapels need slimmer ties.'],
      ['What knot should I tie?', 'Half-Windsor for most occasions — symmetrical, balanced, works with most collar spreads. Four-in-hand for slimmer ties and casual looks — slightly asymmetric.

We demonstrate knots at the store; YouTube tutorials work too.'],

For shorter men, the knot can be tied larger to take up length, or buy shorter ties.'],
      ['What tie color for a navy suit?', 'Burgundy reads classic and conservative. Navy with white dot reads modern. Subtle stripe reads professional. Bold red reads power-tie (use sparingly). Hunter green or olive reads modern fashion. Avoid black ties with navy suits — funeral signal. Avoid bright colors at conservative business meetings — read as costume.'],

    intro: 'The first rule of belts is they match the shoes — black belt with black shoes, brown belt with brown shoes. The second rule is leather, real leather, not bonded synthetic. The third rule is that the belt is sized to the customer\'s actual waist, not the size on the trouser tag. Most men wear belts that are too long because they bought them at the wrong waist size and have to buckle inward, leaving 4 to 6 inches of belt past the buckle.',
    body: 'Dress belts vs casual belts. Dress belts are smooth full-grain leather, 1.25 to 1.5 inches wide, simple metal buckle (silver or gold), polished finish. Black for black shoes, dark brown for dark brown shoes. Casual belts are thicker leather (often 1.5 inches+), can be woven, braided, suede, or distressed leather, with larger or decorative buckles. Casual belts pair with chinos and jeans, dress belts with dress trousers and suits. Belt sizing: belt size = waist size measured at where the belt sits, not the trouser size. Most belts are sized 30 through 44, big and tall belts run 46 through 56. We size on-body at the store and recommend the right buckle hole. Belt loops should sit between holes 2 and 4 of a 5-hole belt — not the first hole (belt too long) and not the last hole (belt too short).',
    serviceType: 'Men\'s leather belts',
    faqs: [
      ['What belt size should I buy?', 'Your actual waist size, measured at where the belt will sit (often the natural waist, sometimes hip-line for low-rise trousers). Belt size is roughly 1 to 2 inches larger than the trouser tag size for the same fit. We measure at the store and recommend the right size; if you are between sizes, go up because belts cannot be lengthened (only shortened by punching a new hole).'],
      ['Do belts and shoes need to match exactly?', 'Same color family, yes — black belt with black shoes, brown belt with brown shoes. Exact shade: not perfect match needed, but close. Dark brown belt with light brown shoes works. Black belt with dark brown shoes does not. The visual rule is "match the leathers" and most customers have one black belt, one dark brown belt, one casual belt covering 95 percent of needs.'],
      ['Do you stock big and tall belts?', 'Yes — big and tall dress belts in black and dark brown to size 56-inch waist stocked. Special order to size 64 with 2 to 3 weeks lead. Casual belts in big and tall less deeply stocked but available. Most big and tall customers buy 1 dress belt and 1 casual belt to start.'],
      ['Can a belt be shortened?', 'Yes — punching extra holes for a tighter fit costs $5 (or free with most belt purchases). Shortening the belt itself by cutting and re-buckling costs $15 if the belt has a removable buckle. Some belts (sewn-on buckles) cannot be shortened. We size at purchase to avoid the issue most often.'],
      ['What buckle style is appropriate for business?', 'Simple metal buckle in silver, gold, or matte tone. Avoid logo buckles (read fashion-brand-flashy in business), avoid oversized buckles (read western or fashion-forward). The classic conservative buckle is a small rectangular silver-tone closure. Modern professional buckles can be slightly larger or matte black-tone but stay simple.'],

    intro: 'Suspenders (or "braces" in proper menswear vocabulary) hold trousers up via shoulder straps rather than belt around the waist. They have three real use cases: formal tuxedo wear (where a belt is incorrect), traditional three-piece suit looks (where the suspenders are visible under an open vest), and big-and-tall customers (where suspenders distribute weight better than a belt around a larger waist). Suspenders should not be worn with a belt simultaneously — that reads costume.',
    body: 'Button vs clip suspenders. Button suspenders attach to internal trouser buttons (sewn inside the waistband) — the formal, traditional method. Clip suspenders attach to the outside of the trouser waistband with metal clips — the casual, modern method. For tuxedos and three-piece suits: button suspenders only. For casual wear and most everyday use: clip suspenders are fine. Tuxedo trousers come with internal suspender buttons; many dress trousers have the buttons too (or they can be added for $15 alterations). Width: 1.25-inch suspenders are dressy, 1.5-inch suspenders are everyday, 2-inch suspenders are casual or work-wear. Color: black silk for tuxedos, white silk for white-tie, matched-color suspenders for three-piece looks, casual patterns for everyday. Big and tall suspenders extend to 60-inch reach for taller customers.',
    serviceType: 'Men\'s suspenders and braces',
    faqs: [
      ['Do I wear suspenders with a belt?', 'No — never simultaneously. Suspenders or belt, not both. Wearing both reads costume and over-dressed. The rule is one or the other; suspenders for formal and three-piece looks, belt for everyday casual and modern business.'],
      ['Are button or clip suspenders better?', 'Button for formal (tuxedos, three-piece suits) and traditional looks. Clip for casual and everyday wear. Button suspenders attach to internal trouser buttons and read more refined; clip suspenders attach externally and read more casual. Most tuxedo trousers have internal buttons; if not, we can add them for $15.'],
      ['Can I wear suspenders with a tuxedo and not see them?', 'Yes — suspenders are designed to be worn under tuxedo waistcoat or cummerbund. They hold the trousers up cleanly without the bulk of a belt around the waist (a belt would create a visible ridge under the formal vest or jacket). Black silk suspenders are standard for tuxedo wear.'],
      ['Do you stock big and tall suspenders?', 'Yes — big and tall suspenders extend to 60-inch reach (longer suspenders for taller customers and big and tall waist sizes). Stocked in black, dark brown, white silk (formal), and basic patterns. Special-order custom-length suspenders available with 2 to 3 weeks lead.'],
      ['How wide should suspenders be?', '1.25-inch for very dressy and formal (tuxedos, three-piece suits with vest). 1.5-inch for everyday and most business casual. 2-inch for very casual or work-wear style. The wider the suspender, the more casual it reads.'],

    intro: 'Cufflinks are paired-jewelry pieces that fasten French-cuff (double-cuff) dress shirts at the wrist. They serve a structural purpose (closing the cuff) and a decorative one (a small visible signal at the edge of the sleeve). Most men own one or two pairs and rotate; serious cufflink collectors own dozens and treat them like watches — small, visible, status pieces.',
    body: 'Three categories of cufflinks. Classic cufflinks: silver-tone, gold-tone, or matte-tone metal in simple geometric shapes (square, oval, round). The everyday cufflink, appropriate for business and most formal occasions. Novelty cufflinks: themed cufflinks with personality — sports team logos, monogrammed initials, hobby symbols, professional symbols (legal scales, medical caduceus, military insignia). Read more personal and casual; appropriate for weddings, less formal events, or as gifts. Formal cufflinks: high-shine silver or gold, often with onyx, mother-of-pearl, or precious stone accents. For tuxedo wear and formal occasions only — read costume in business settings. We stock all three across price ranges from $29 (basic silver-tone) to $129 (premium silver with stone accent), with engraving available for monograms ($25 add-on, 2 weeks turn).',
    serviceType: 'Cufflinks',
    faqs: [
      ['Do I need cufflinks for a wedding?', 'Only if your dress shirt has French cuffs (double cuffs that fold back and close with cufflinks). Standard barrel-cuff dress shirts do not use cufflinks. Most groom shirts for formal weddings are French cuff and need cufflinks — silver-tone with onyx or mother-of-pearl is the classic wedding choice.'],
      ['What cufflinks for a tuxedo?', 'Formal cufflinks: high-shine silver or gold, often with onyx (black stone) or mother-of-pearl (white stone) accents. The black stone reads more masculine and formal; the white stone reads more elegant. Both are correct. Avoid novelty cufflinks with tuxedos — they clash with the formal pattern.'],
      ['Are cufflinks engravable?', 'Yes — silver and gold cufflinks can be engraved with monograms, dates, initials, or short phrases. Engraving runs $25 per cufflink ($50 for the pair) and adds 2 weeks to delivery. Common engravings: groom\'s initials, wedding date, anniversary date. We send out for engraving; the engraver is local in Buford and accurate.'],
      ['What is the difference between fixed-back and chain cufflinks?', 'Fixed-back (or "torpedo back" / "swivel back") have the back piece attached rigidly to the cufflink — easier to put on, more secure. Chain-link have a small chain connecting the front and back — slightly more elegant in profile, slightly trickier to put on. Most modern cufflinks are fixed-back; chain-link is more traditional.'],
      ['Can cufflinks be worn casually?', 'Generally no — cufflinks require French-cuff shirts which are inherently dressy. The exception is novelty cufflinks with smart-casual button-downs that have French cuffs (rare, fashion-forward). Most men wear cufflinks only with suits and tuxedos and consider them dressy by default.'],

    intro: 'Outerwear is the layer over the suit in cold weather and rain. North Georgia winters are milder than the upper Midwest but still cold enough that a topcoat or overcoat is essential from November through March. The right outerwear elevates a suit; the wrong outerwear (a puffer over a suit, a casual jacket over a tuxedo) ruins the silhouette in photos.',
    body: 'Three outerwear categories. Topcoats and overcoats: wool or wool blend, knee-length to mid-thigh, single or double-breasted, in charcoal, camel, or navy. The classic over-suit layer for fall and winter. Topcoats are slightly shorter and lighter (waist to knee); overcoats are longer (knee to mid-calf) and heavier. Raincoats: traditional trench coat in tan or khaki, or modern slim raincoat in black or charcoal. Pairs over suits in rain. Field jackets and casual outerwear: M-65 field jacket, Barbour-style waxed cotton jacket, leather jacket. Pair with chinos and casual wear, not suits. We stock topcoats and raincoats in 36S through 56L (including big and tall) and field jackets in 36 through 50R. Tailoring on outerwear takes longer than suits because the construction is heavier — sleeve adjust 5 to 7 days, body alteration 10 to 14 days.',
    serviceType: 'Men\'s outerwear and overcoats',
    faqs: [
      ['What outerwear should I wear over a suit?', 'Topcoat or overcoat in wool or wool blend. Topcoat for milder cold (fall, early winter), overcoat for serious cold. Charcoal is the safest and most universal color. Camel reads classic and warm. Navy works with grey suits well. Avoid casual jackets (puffer, ski jacket, hooded parka) over a suit — the silhouette clashes.'],
      ['What is the difference between a topcoat and overcoat?', 'Length and weight. Topcoat: waist to knee, lighter wool, fall and milder winter. Overcoat: knee to mid-calf, heavier wool, deep winter. Topcoats are more versatile and the better single-purchase choice for most north Georgia winters. Overcoats are appropriate for travel to colder climates or extended outdoor wear.'],
      ['Can outerwear be tailored?', 'Yes, but it takes longer than suit tailoring because the construction is heavier. Sleeve adjust runs 5 to 7 days. Body taper or shortening runs 10 to 14 days. Lining repairs 7 to 10 days. We do all outerwear alterations in-house with master tailors familiar with the construction.'],
      ['Do you carry big and tall outerwear?', 'Yes — topcoats and overcoats in 46R through 56L stocked. Special order beyond 56L runs 4 to 6 weeks. Big and tall outerwear is one of the harder categories to stock because of fabric volume; we keep navy and charcoal deepest in larger sizes.'],
      ['What outerwear works with a tuxedo?', 'A long-line wool overcoat in black is the classic over-tuxedo layer. Avoid raincoats (read off with formal tuxedos), avoid casual jackets, avoid puffers. Some grooms skip outerwear and run from car to venue rather than ruin the photo line; this is a valid choice if the distance is short and the weather is not extreme.'],

We carry casual pieces that take alterations — polos that can be tapered, casual button-downs that can be sleeved properly, chinos that can be hemmed and tapered to fit.

Tailored on-site for body taper and shoulder. Casual button-downs: oxford cloth, chambray, flannel, and lightweight linen casual shirts. Slightly fuller cut than dress shirts; can be tucked or untucked. Chinos: cotton or cotton-blend casual trousers in flat-front modern fit and pleated classic fit. Hemmed and tapered on-site. Sweaters and knitwear: merino crewneck, V-neck, half-zip, and cardigan sweaters. Cotton-blend cardigans for warmer weather.

A $59 chino from us tailored to your body looks better than a $79 chino off the rack at a chain store. The difference is body taper, hem, and shoulder fit — small adjustments that make casual wear look intentional rather than thrown on.'],
      ['What polos do you stock?', 'Cotton pique polos in solid colors (white, navy, black, light blue, mid-grey, hunter green, burgundy) and basic patterns (subtle stripe, microcheck). Merino wool polos in finer construction for cooler weather. Sizes 36 through 50 standard, big and tall in select solids. All polos can be body-tapered to fit better.'],
      ['How are chinos different from casual khakis?', 'Construction and fit. Our chinos are slightly heavier-weight cotton, sit cleaner through the leg, and take alterations like a dress trouser. Department-store casual khakis are lighter cotton, looser cut, and meant for one-and-done wear. The chinos we stock are designed to be tailored and rotated like dress trousers.'],
      ['Do you offer alterations on casual wear?', 'Yes — same pricing as dress alterations. Polo body taper $25, chino hem $15, casual button-down sleeve $25. Casual wear benefits more from alterations than most men realize because off-the-rack casual is the loosest in the menswear ecosystem.'],
      ['What is the difference between modern fit and classic fit casual wear?', 'Modern fit is slightly tapered through the body and trimmer overall — the contemporary cut. Classic fit is straight and fuller — the traditional cut. Most men under 50 wear modern fit casual wear; most men over 60 wear classic fit by preference and habit. Both are appropriate; the choice is style and body type.'],
